## Conversion Strategy

### Entry Points

- **Endowment Effect**: "Your personalized career roadmap" language
- **Loss Aversion**: Show missed opportunities for freemium users
- **Social Proof**: Premium badges for corporate visibility

## Critical Business Rules

### Access Control
- **Course Access**: Lose access upon premium expiry, can regain by renewal
- **Mid-Course Expiry**: Access blocked immediately on plan expiration
- **Free Modules**: Remain accessible after premium expiry
- **Completed Content**: Lost access unless plan renewed

### Payment Handling
- **Failed Payments**: Push premium plan rather than refund
- **Existing Purchases**: No charge if previous purchases exceed premium cost
- **NCET Plus Users**: Reduced upgrade pricing
- **Account Sharing**: One device/session enforcement

### Reminder System
- **Renewal Reminders**: Start from 10th month
- **Extension Timing**: New plan starts after current expiry (no overlap)
- **Post-Expiry**: New plan active from payment date

## Development Notes

### UI/UX Requirements
- Use lock icons, tooltips for premium-only features
- Highlight premium users with badges
- Premium replaces NCET Plus logos on upgrade
- Unified Premium Plan page for benefits/pricing

### Technical Considerations
- Free modules need to be implemented within courses
- Push functionality for premium plan activation
- Session management for account sharing prevention
- Payment failure handling with plan activation

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Course Mid-Progress**: Access blocked on expiry
2. **Extension Timing**: Plans don't overlap
3. **Payment Glitches**: Push plan instead of refund
4. **Account Sharing**: One device limitation
5. **Mixed Course Content**: 20% free spans all sections
6. **NCET Plus Duration**: Minimum 3 months required
